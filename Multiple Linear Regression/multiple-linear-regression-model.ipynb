    "The dataset provides multiple parameters that could be related to the travel duration. This approach generates a linear combination of parameters with weights to generate the output duration thus allowing the use of more than one parameter (as would have been the case for simple linear regression). This will form a baseline machine learning model to evaluate other models used later on."
