# Yash Puneet CSE 151B Final Project

## Porto, Portugal Taxi Travel Time Prediction

### File Structure:

- Data Visualizations
    - Data visualization notebook pdf and ipynb file
- Dual Stage Predition Model
    - Deep Learning Model including final model code notebook pdf and ipynb file
- Multiple Linear Regression
    - Initial Model using Multiple linear regression ipynb file and pdf file
- Saved Models
    - Saved Models for velocity and duration predictor
    - Being a two stage model, both models need to be loaded and used
    - The initial tensor needs to be passed into velocity predictor
    - The output from this then needs to be combined with the above tensor before being passed into the duration predictor for the final output
- Deliverables (Slides and Report) are in the top level
